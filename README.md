## General Information

This project was created for the simple reason that I needed a good clock for studying and I couldn't find one, and I was like: 
why not create something that it's done by mine and many other people's taste: simple, easy to use, and useful at the same time.

### One another upside:

Very easy to modify the code if you want to include some cycles of pomodoro and so on.

### Inspired

This app was also inspired by [StudyMD](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5CRP-6oxYenIgBj17CkBZg) and [James Scholz](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMwo6hT5hI3R56rO2HYP-wQ)

## Instructions if you need to use this app with Git Bush

## Short Instructions

```
$ cd "C:\Users\YOUR_PC_USERNAME\Desktop"
$ git clone https://github.com/IvanoskiHarmonia/TimerJS
```

## Detailed Instructions

Navigate through the place where you want to download/clone the timer, example:

go to ```This PC``` on Windows, there you should be able to see the desktop folder, then do:

``` Right Click -> Copy as Path ```

Then go back to Git Bush, and execute this command:

``` $ cd "C:\Users\YOUR_PC_USERNAME\Desktop" -> Press Enter/Return ```

this will navigate your Git Bush to Desktop, and if that is your desired, just write this command:

``` $ git clone https://github.com/IvanoskiHarmonia/TimerJS ```

# Dollar Sign

`do not forget: $ should not be used, because it is already there.` 
if curious: $ is showing that we're in the system shell, i.e. the program that you're put into as soon as you open the Terminal app.
The dollar sign is often the symbol used to signify where you can begin typing in commands
